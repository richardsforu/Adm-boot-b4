Jax-rs runtime env does following:
1) Receives HTTP request message
2) Extract xml message from above http req message
3) Delegates to jaxb and passes above xml message
4) Wait for object from jaxb
5) Invokes resource method & passes above object as an argument.
6) If required, Response object internally created.
7) The above Response object is converted to HTTP response message & sends back to client application.
