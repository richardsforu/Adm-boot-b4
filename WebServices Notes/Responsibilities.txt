In web services there are 2 architectural styles:
	1) soap style
	2) rest style
-----------------------------------------
If our project requirement is to represent same data but in diff formats such as xml, json, html, etc then go for REST style.
In REST style, message layer security is not possible rather only transport layer security using https is possible.
In SOAP style, we can provide security both at message layer security as well as transport layer. 
Hence if our project requirement is more robustness then go for SOAP style.
---------------------------------------

The following APIs are used to develop SOAP based applications:
	1) AXIS2 API
	2) JAX-RPC API
	3) JAX-WS  API
	4) Apache CXF Framework [Preferred]

Responsibilities:
1) Developed services using Apache CXF framework.
2) Configured services as beans in spring configuration file using DI.
3) Tested services using SOAP UI.

The following APIs are used to develop REST based applications:
	1) JAX-RS API
	2) SPRING with REST API [Preferred]
	3) JAX-WS  API
	4) Apache CXF Framework

Responsibilities:
1) Developed resources using SPRING with REST.
2) Configured resources as beans in spring configuration file using DI.
3) Tested resources using POSTMAN plug-in / SOAP UI.
4) Consumed resources using RestTemplate.
